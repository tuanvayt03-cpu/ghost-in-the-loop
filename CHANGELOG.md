# Changelog

## [Ghost+ 0.15.29] — keep the real ChatGPT conversation name

- Ignore same-page accessibility links (including `#main` / “Chuyển đến nội dung”) when finding the current sidebar conversation.
- Trust the visible conversation label before `title` and `aria-label`; reject generic navigation labels and repair stale Ghost-prefixed titles.
- Preserve exactly one red dot for a blocked HUMAN gate, and restore the actual task name when the gate clears, the tab changes, or React renames the conversation.
- Add Chromium regression fixtures for real Vietnamese skip links and poisoned tooltip/aria labels; retain the no-duplicate-Send controls from 0.15.28.
- Automated fixture evidence is not authenticated live UI acceptance. Firefox `check:committed` mismatch remains separately tracked.

## [8.8.5] — production dispatch router and Firefox/Android round-2 repair

### P0 Perplexity / fallback controls follow-up

- Fix current Perplexity Lexical staging so one Ghost command produces one composer payload instead of a duplicated payload that fails COMPOSER-002 verification.
- Add one bounded pre-dispatch repair for the exact duplicate-payload field signature; it cannot grant Send authority.
- Put Auto / Alpha / Beta / Gamma / Delta directly in the production Transport panel and bind them to the production dispatch router.
- After a human confirms a route did not send, Auto suppresses that failed route temporarily and selects another eligible route on the next safe attempt.
- Resume now retries the exact volatile command after a known pre-dispatch failure; the retry memory is cleared before the at-most-once journal opens and on reset.

- Integrate Alpha/Beta/Gamma/Delta into the production engine instead of leaving them in a recovery-only sidecar. Alpha uses the freshly reacquired reviewed Send click; Beta uses the exact current composer form with requestSubmit; Gamma uses the reviewed Enter fallback; Delta stages for one manual host Send when no automatic route is safe.
- On Firefox/Android ChatGPT, rotate Alpha → Beta → Gamma by confirmed round so the known second-round failure no longer repeats the identical reviewed-button actuator. Exactly one route is selected before the at-most-once journal starts; there is still no post-dispatch automatic retry.
- Suppress a route for 12 hours after an ambiguous SEND-002 so a later safe run can exercise another route without blindly resending the uncertain transaction.
- Add #composer-submit-button as a first-class ChatGPT Send identity, wait two animation frames for ProseMirror/React reconciliation, then reacquire both staged composer and Send authority immediately before dispatch.
- Enrich redacted telemetry with route, composer replacement/poll counts, Send connectivity, same-form/requestSubmit eligibility, user-turn delta, and trusted-pulse age. No prompts, selectors, URLs, or conversation text are added.
- Add regression coverage for a replaced ChatGPT composer where the first identical send selects Alpha and the second selects Beta on Firefox/Android.

**Safety boundary:** an ambiguous post-dispatch state still hard-stops. Alternate automatic actuators are never fired inside the same uncertain transaction.

## [8.8.4] — mobile Send confirmation and release parity

- Confirm a reviewed Send when ChatGPT creates a new user turn after the at-most-once actuation; this adds an independent delivery signal without treating composer clearing or Send disappearance alone as success.
- Extend the bounded Send-confirmation window from 9s to 18s for slower Firefox/Android host transitions. Unconfirmed attempts still become SEND-002 and fail closed with no resend.
- Preserve the 8.8.3 large P · COMMIT RECOMMENDATION action and panel-position/scroll stability, while bringing the stale regression fixtures forward.
- Restore package, manifest, userscript, and generated Firefox extension parity.
- Carry the separately tested Alpha/Beta/Gamma/Delta R3 recovery fallback as release-candidate evidence.

**Field boundary:** Chromium/Firefox automated certification can validate the state machine and UI, but authenticated Firefox/Android remains the final live-host proof.

## [8.8.2] — live composer replacement repair

Authenticated Chrome field tests on ChatGPT and Perplexity showed that 8.8.1
could visibly insert the complete continuation and still pause before Send with
`COMPOSER-002`. Both production editors can replace their contenteditable node
during framework reconciliation, while Ghost 8.8.1 verified only the original
pre-injection element.

- Reacquire all reviewed current composer candidates after injection and accept
  only the unique node retaining the complete normalized prompt.
- Require the same exact prompt-bearing composer across two consecutive
  observations before opening the at-most-once Send journal.
- Use the reacquired composer for the reviewed Enter fallback and transaction
  evidence, without adding a new actuator or weakening exact matching.
- Add real-browser fixtures for whole-composer replacement with both retained
  and truncated prompts; retained text dispatches once, truncated text remains
  `COMPOSER-002` with zero Send activation.
- Record the authenticated live-canary and BrowserStack evidence boundary so
  hosted mocks and emulation cannot be promoted to live certification.


## [8.8.1] — ChatGPT send compatibility candidate and authority hardening

Field regression on real ChatGPT after 8.8.0: Ghost inserted the continuation
text into the composer but it never sent, and Ghost-owned controls appeared to
jump the page toward the top.

- **Bounded Send compatibility:** added
  `button[aria-label="Send message"]` to ChatGPT's reviewed selector set. This
  covers a plausible host variant without changing the one-actuator transaction
  model. It is not claimed as the proven field root cause: a current signed-out
  public ChatGPT probe instead exposed `#composer-submit-button` with
  `aria-label="Send prompt"` and `data-testid="send-button"`, both already
  covered by 8.8.0. The failing authenticated layout remains unobserved.
- **Global ambiguity rejection:** `_reviewedSend()` now deduplicates aliases for
  the same DOM node across the complete reviewed-selector and human-taught
  authority union, and returns an actuator only when that union contains exactly
  one node. Previously, two plausible controls could bypass fail-closed behavior
  when a later selector happened to match only one of them; a taught selector
  that drifted to multiple live controls could also return its first match.
- **Ghost control semantics:** every rendered Ghost button is explicitly
  normalized to `type="button"`. The earlier candidate's global click
  `preventDefault()` guard was removed: `#gitl` mounts directly under `body`, so
  no ChatGPT form/anchor ancestry was demonstrated, and intercepting every click
  did not establish the scroll-jump root cause.
- Regression coverage now includes exact-node alias deduplication, cross-selector
  and taught-selector ambiguity, disabled/menu/disclosure decoys, hidden and
  replaced Send nodes, the observed signed-out public composer shape, and
  real-browser fixtures for taught-selector drift plus Ghost state changes with
  no host form submission, URL/hash mutation, Send click, or scroll movement.
  The diagnostic field shim remains a temporary probe, not production
  architecture.

**Live-certification boundary:** this candidate is backed by deterministic tests
and a read-only signed-out public DOM inspection. It was **not** verified against
an authenticated live ChatGPT session and must not be described as a proven
field repair or live-certified release. Live ChatGPT actuation remains a required
release gate — see
`docs/CHATGPT_8_8_LIVE_REGRESSION_HANDOFF.md`.

## [8.8.0] — workflow-neutral controls and explicit decisions

- Fixed false COMPOSER-002 pauses for complete multiline prompts in block-structured contenteditable editors by verifying rendered semantic text while retaining exact normalized staging checks.
- Added context-aware adapter capability states so idle conditional controls do not create false ADAPTER-001 reports, while missing controls during required operations still fail closed.
- Added a health-gated Repair & Resume action that rebuilds Ghost runtime services and rearms paused observation without injecting a prompt, clicking Continue, or opening a Send transaction itself.
- Made Advanced a real opt-in boundary: Basic injects only PROCEED, CHOICE, and HALT and leaves the user's existing workflow untouched.
- Added an optional Advanced committee shortcut where a user reply of P accepts only an option explicitly labeled Recommended by committee.
- Basic mode now pauses on a missing control marker instead of auto-injecting methodology or a recovery continuation.
- Added `[[GITL::CHOICE]]` as a first-class, fail-safe state: Ghost stops all automatic actions when the model needs a user decision.
- Reclassified question-like continuation phrases as CHOICE rather than PROCEED, preventing automatic answers to the model.
- Added a distinct Choice needed status and one reviewed Send choice path that preserves the existing task and round count.
- Kept plain-language behavior in the default help while moving exact marker details to the Advanced injected-prompt preview.

### 8.8 release-candidate evidence boundary — not published

Later 8.8 lifecycle, Long-Chat, structural-shell, and BUILD-IDENTITY work is candidate implementation/certification evidence on the isolated `agent/8.8-repair-resume` branch; it is **not** publication authority. Stable install/update authority remains `main`, `publishReady` remains false, and no merge, tag, GitHub Release, store publication, or stable-channel switch is implied.

- **Round 4 lifecycle:** accepted only at bounded deterministic/hosted scope. Synthetic freeze/resume/discard fixtures and Pixel-class emulation do not certify physical Android discard/freeze, real browser scheduler suspension/discard, Firefox-Android/GeckoView lifecycle behavior, or calibrated low-end hardware.
- **Round 5 Long Chat:** the grouped-selector improvement remains history-linear, and the safety-critical Send-observation path remains history-linear. Hosted wall-clock timing is reproducibility evidence rather than a calibrated device budget: same-payload runs include green and timing-only red/flaky observations, including run `31251250525`. Accepted numerical thresholds were not weakened. Physical Android and GeckoView remain uncertified.
- **Round 6 structural shell:** accepted only at bounded deterministic/hosted ChatGPT + Claude cross-adapter scope. Structural authority remains fail-closed and separate from Send authority, with demotion to standard adapter-aware behavior and then rail when structural verification is absent or uncertain. Exact current live ChatGPT/Claude insertion remains **UNKNOWN / NOT CERTIFIED**; physical Android/WebView/GeckoView, real IME/browser-toolbar, assistive-technology mappings, and calibrated low-end-device performance remain uncertified.
- **Round 7 BUILD-IDENTITY:** candidate identity is bound to immutable shipped-payload bytes plus explicit provenance/test/channel classification; coordination-only head movement is not a new payload. Candidate identity is not publication identity.
- **Dependency disposition:** `brace-expansion@1.1.15` and `js-yaml@3.14.2` remain real high-severity indirect nodes in the Jest development graph. `npm audit --omit=dev --json` reported zero vulnerabilities and no concrete shipped-payload path was established; shipped exploitability remains **UNKNOWN / NOT CLAIMED** and no blind dependency upgrade is authorized by this evidence.

See `docs/RELEASE-CANDIDATE-8.8.md` and canonical `.gitl/evidence/round-4` through `round-8` records for exact evidence, test bindings, dissent, and certification limits.

## [8.7.1] — mobile wake recovery and reliable controls

- Added layered automatic recovery after phone lock, app switching, background suspension, BFCache restoration, and focus return.
- Rebuilds stale caches, ticker, heartbeat, tab lease, GhostBus, and control detection through one idempotent recovery gate.
- Restores a previously running loop only when safe; unresolved or uncertain Send transactions pause without replay.
- Added focused wake-recovery regression coverage and kept page reload, reground prompts, and automatic resend prohibited.
- Reserved a dedicated tab-help strip so help controls no longer cover the Personas committee toggle.
- Verified the reliability changes through unit, base-certification, Chromium, Firefox, and mobile Chromium test tiers before release-candidate packaging.

## [8.7.0] — verified composer staging and portable mobile test gate

Ghost now observes the complete normalized prompt in the live composer before
opening the at-most-once Send journal. A framework-controlled editor that drops,
truncates, or replaces injected text produces `COMPOSER-002`, pauses loudly,
and never reaches a Send actuator. The check treats rich-editor whitespace as
representation detail but requires every non-whitespace character to match.

The Playwright harness accepts an explicit browser executable and includes a
Pixel 7 mobile project for the staging/dispatch contract. Package, lockfile,
userscript, manifest, and changelog versions are now guarded by one consistency
test so release metadata cannot silently remain on an older version.

## [8.6.1] — ChatGPT mobile send (reviewed Enter fallback)

**Field report (Android / Firefox, chatgpt.com):** the loop inserted the prompt
but paused every round with `SEND-001 — No safe Send mechanism`. On ChatGPT's
mobile web composer the Send button isn't a uniquely resolvable reviewed
control (it's hidden behind a dictation button until a native keystroke), so
`getSendBtn()` returned null and — because ChatGPT declared no fallback — the
transaction dead-ended.

**Fix:** ChatGPT now declares `dispatchFallback: 'enter'`, the same reviewed
single-dispatch mechanism Perplexity already uses. Its ProseMirror composer
submits on Enter, so when no unique reviewed button resolves Ghost fires exactly
**one** Enter `keydown` on the composer — chosen before the at-most-once journal
opens, with no escalation. Desktop is unchanged: the reviewed button still wins
and the Enter path is never reached there.

If a user has turned off ChatGPT's default "Enter sends message" setting, the
Enter fallback becomes a no-op — the send is then marked *uncertain* (composer
not cleared), never double-sent and never falsely confirmed. Teach Send remains
available for any composer this still can't drive.

## [8.6.0] — Teach Mode: user-taught Send / input controls

When a site (or a mobile DOM) hides the Send button or chat input behind
markup Ghost can't auto-detect, the loop had no way forward. Teach Mode lets
the human close that gap once, by hand.

### What it does
In the Run tab, when a control is missing (or already taught) Ghost shows
**Teach Send** / **Teach Input** buttons. Arming one puts Ghost in capture
mode; the user taps the real control **once**. Ghost derives a stable selector
(`SelectorMemory.derive`) and stores it **per host** (`TeachStore`, key
`gitlTaught`). From then on Ghost uses the taught control on that site.
**Forget** clears it.

### It is still a reviewed actuator — never a blind clicker
- A taught **Send** is treated as a *human-reviewed* actuator, so it is honoured
  even on sites Ghost hasn't formally reviewed — but it is re-checked through
  `_sendLooksSafe` on **every** resolve. If the taught element ever looks like a
  menu / attach / stop control, it is refused. Teaching a popup-toggle
  (`aria-haspopup`) is vetoed at capture time with a hint, and nothing is stored.
- A taught **input** must resolve to a `<textarea>` or `contenteditable`; any
  other tap is rejected.
- Capture uses `preventDefault` + `stopPropagation` on the teaching tap and
  swallows the trailing `mousedown`/`click` of that same gesture, so **teaching
  a control never actually presses it**.

### Wiring
`_reviewedSend()` consults `TeachStore.matchEl('send')` *before* the
reviewed-platform gate; `Adapter.peekInput()` consults `TeachStore.matchEl('input')`
between the platform selector and selector memory. No change to the
at-most-once send transaction: a taught send is still a single reviewed
mechanism chosen before the journal opens.

## [8.5.3] — single-dispatch send, sharper answer selection, model-switch gating

Integrates the v8.5.3 handoff package (Agent CG's item 1 + item 2, which the
other environment couldn't push) plus a field fix for model-switch workflows.

### Single-dispatch transaction authority (item 2)
Replaces the v8.4.2 layered send chain with **one** reviewed mechanism chosen
*before* the at-most-once journal opens: a unique reviewed Send button, or —
only where the adapter declares it (`dispatchFallback:'enter'`, currently
Perplexity) — a single Enter `keydown`. Once the transaction begins the chosen
mechanism fires exactly once; a dispatch exception becomes `uncertain`, never a
second actuator. No escalation, no double-send window. If no single reviewed
mechanism exists, the prompt is left for manual Send.

### Sharper answer selection (item 1, read-only)
Perplexity's broad `.pb-md > div` is now a fallback tier; answer detection
restores document order, bounds the scan, ignores hidden/nav/follow-up nodes,
and anchors on the newest answer so an older HALT can't beat a newer streaming
reply. Cannot click, inject, submit, or alter actuator authority.

### Model-switch workflows are gated to model-switcher platforms
Field report: **Lens Relay's "Name which model should go next" fired on
ChatGPT**, which has one model. Model-switch features (the live round-table
persona and the Lens Relay workflow) now check `_isModelSwitcher()` (Perplexity/
arena sites). On a single-model platform the "name the next model" instruction
is stripped from injected workflow stages, so Lens Relay degrades to a
single-model multi-lens round table instead of asking a one-model site to pick
the next model.

## [8.5.2] — completion observer, visible run stages, Ghost-only reboot

- Fixed Perplexity remaining in reading/waiting forever: Socket.IO heartbeat and control frames no longer count as generation output.
- Added three independent completion catches: a reply newer than the send baseline, a stable tail across two ticks, and no visible Stop control. Stable visible PROCEED/HALT can override stale network telemetry.
- Run status now shows Output → Marker check → Next command/HALT, including the real pre-send countdown. Drift guard is a separate right-hand section.
- Header ↻ now reloads Ghost only (timers, observers, caches, panel, tab lock, bus, selector detection) without reloading the long chat or sending a reground prompt. Selector-only re-detect remains in Diagnostics.
- Composer Rail now follows composer replacement and geometry with ResizeObserver, MutationObserver and a low-frequency check, still without a page-scroll listener or host-editor injection.

## [8.5.1] — mobile field fixes (orb, rail jump, lag, picker overflow)

Field reports from Perplexity on mobile:

- **Orb showed a broken blob, not a clean circle.** The collapsed orb's button
  span carries an inline `display:flex`, so the hide rule lost to it and the
  ghost + platform badge + buttons spilled outside the circle. Now hidden with
  `!important` (+ the pieces individually), and the orb is width-capped.
- **The new rail (⊟) button was unreachable.** The position picker overflowed at
  9 options and clipped the last one. The row now wraps.
- **The panel jumped around while scrolling.** The rail repositioned on every
  scroll event. Chat composers are fixed/sticky, so the rail now follows only
  viewport CHANGES (resize / mobile keyboard), never page scroll — and only
  docks to a composer in the lower part of the screen (so it can't latch onto a
  stray input near the top and fly around).
- **Animations lagged the whole page while running.** Heavy GPU effects —
  `backdrop-filter: blur` above all, plus animated gradient borders/sheen — are
  now disabled on touch devices (`pointer: coarse`). The panel stays fully
  functional, just static, and the page stops janking.

Known, still under investigation: on mobile Perplexity the loop may still not
auto-continue. Leading cause was the page lag above (a starved detection tick);
if it persists after this release it's the mobile composer's send path (Enter
not submitting in that editor), which needs the real mobile selector.

## [8.5.0] — Composer Rail: Ghost docks to the chat box

A new **`rail`** position mode (Setup → position row, the ⊟ icon). It's the
first "part of the composer" interface — done the safe way:

- **Collapsed = a slim bar** (ghost + Play/Pause + status) that **docks just
  above the site's chat box**, positioned by geometry from the composer Ghost
  already finds. **It never covers the input** — it hugs the composer's top edge
  (and flips below only if the composer is at the very top).
- **Tap to open** the full panel, which pins *above* the composer and grows
  upward, so the input stays clear. The expand button (＋) opens it; the play
  button still plays.
- **Follows the composer** on scroll, resize, and the mobile keyboard
  (VisualViewport-aware) — the tracker is rAF-coalesced and only runs in rail
  mode (no idle loop, no permanent listeners).
- **No site injection.** The rail is Ghost's own panel repositioned by geometry;
  it never inserts a node into the page, never touches the editor, and stays
  inside `#gitl` (so own-UI isolation and skins apply). If no composer is found
  it degrades to a bottom strip above the safe area.

This is opt-in — your current position is untouched until you pick **rail**, and
one tap switches back to the orb or any other mode. It's the safe realization of
"Ghost as part of the chat bubble"; the deeper *inject-into-the-site-composer*
variants still go through the flagged, per-site research track.

Geometry is a pure helper (`_railBox`) with unit tests; mount/dock/expand/
no-overlap and the no-composer fallback are covered by `tests/e2e/rail.spec.js`
in Chromium + Firefox.

## [8.4.2] — layered send failsafes (mobile Perplexity fix, ADAPTER-001)

Fixes the field bug where mobile Perplexity (Firefox/Android) sent round 1 then
paused with `send:false`: its follow-up composer has no uniquely-matching
reviewed Send button, and send was button-only.

**The fix is a failsafe chain, not a weakening of safety.** Send now escalates
through: **reviewed button → single Enter keypress → insertParagraph → native
form submit** — but each method fires **only while the composer still holds the
unsent text.** The instant the composer clears (or independent evidence
confirms the send), escalation stops and no further method is dispatched. So:

- **At-most-once is preserved *in effect*** — a second method can never fire
  after one already sent, so your prompt cannot double-send. This keeps the
  guarantee of CG's v8.3.0 send-transaction design; it only changes *button-only*
  into *button-then-buttonless-while-unsent*.
- **Buttonless failsafes are reviewed-platforms only.** An unreviewed site with
  no reviewed button still leaves the prompt for manual Send (unchanged).
- **Commit still requires independent evidence** (`_sendEvidence`: assistant
  grew, or composer cleared + stop/trusted-network). A dispatch that produced no
  send can never advance the round. No automatic resend of a completed attempt.

Regression tests: `tests/sendlayered.test.js` (chain + double-send guard) and an
updated `tests/sendtransaction.test.js` contract.

## [8.4.1] — one Play/Pause toggle (transport cleanup)

Field feedback: the Run tab showed **Play + Pause + Stop** as three buttons —
"why do we have play, pause, resume AND stop?" The primary button was already
wired to the state-aware `primaryAction` toggle, so the separate Pause button
was redundant. Consolidated to a **single state-driven button** that reads live
state, plus a separate Stop:

- IDLE / COMPLETE → **▶ Start**
- RUNNING → **⏸ Pause**
- PAUSED → **▶ Resume**
- LIMIT (drift checkpoint) → **▶ Continue**

So the button always reflects whether the loop is running — no more guessing
between Start / Resume / Pause.

### Known, diagnosed, NOT yet fixed here — mobile Perplexity send (ADAPTER-001)
A field report (Firefox/Android on Perplexity) shows the loop sending round 1
then pausing with `send:false`. Root cause: the v8.3.0 reviewed-send authority
sends only through a **uniquely-matching reviewed button**, and Perplexity's
mobile follow-up composer relabels/duplicates that button so `_reviewedSend()`
returns null — and `engineSend` deliberately has **no** keyboard/form fallback
(the "at-most-once send" contract, guarding against double-sends). Fixing this
means either capturing the real mobile selector or adding a *single* evidence-
gated composer-submit fallback — a change to that safety contract, so it's held
for an explicit decision rather than shipped silently.

## [8.4.0] — Ghost Orb: a tiny tucked launcher (least screen coverage)

Built on top of the 8.3.0 reliability lineage — none of that work is changed.
This adds one new **`orb`** entry to the existing position picker (Setup →
position row), so users get another *working* placement to choose from and can
fall back if one doesn't suit a site/device.

- **Collapsed = a ~52px circle tucked ~12px past the screen edge.** Only the
  ghost shows; a ring around it **spins while a loop is RUNNING** and sits
  still otherwise (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- **Tap to open** the full panel as an edge drawer; minimise returns it to the
  orb. Open height stays under the existing body cap, so it never swallows the
  composer on mobile — the fix for `bottom-bar` overlapping the composer.
- **Drag to move**: vertical reposition, and dragging across the screen midline
  **snaps it to the other edge**. Stored as edge + a 0..1 ratio, so it survives
  resize and orientation changes.

Site-agnostic and lives inside `#gitl`, so `_isOwnUI` already owns it and the
skin tokens theme it — no Shadow DOM, no innerHTML strings (Trusted-Types safe),
no change to the send/actuator authority. Geometry is pure (`_orbEdgeFromX`,
`_orbClampY`) with unit tests; mount/tuck/running-ring/tap-expand/drag-snap are
covered by `tests/e2e/orb.spec.js` in Chromium + Firefox.

**Deliberately NOT shipped (needs real-device work first):** the composer-
integrated concepts explored alongside this — injecting a Ghost button into each
site's toolbar, adding an item to the site's "+" menu, or a two-mode tabbed
composer that overlays and disables the real input. Those depend on per-site
composer DOM across ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Perplexity/Manus/Kimi and would put
Ghost's UI on top of the very input it must type into (the issue #4/#5 surface),
so they belong behind a flag with live per-site captures, not a blind push.

## [8.3.0] — fail-closed reliability, truthful exports, and private diagnostics

Updated by **MShneur**. Main editor: **Agent CG (ChatGPT)**.

This release implements the system-level reliability audit rather than adding
another provider-specific patch. The runtime now treats Send as an at-most-once
transaction, separates observation from actuator authority, reports export
completeness honestly, and keeps diagnostic evidence local and redacted.

### Send is an explicit transaction

- A prompt moves through `dispatching → committed | uncertain | failed`.
- Only one unique, visible, enabled control from a reviewed platform adapter may
  be clicked. Heuristic Send candidates remain diagnostic-only.
- Send selectors are never learned or persisted. Existing learned Send entries
  are removed on lookup.
- One click is attempted. Enter, form-submit, refocus, and blind retry fallbacks
  were removed.
- A Send is confirmed only by an assistant transition or correlated evidence
  (`composer cleared + stop control` or `composer cleared + trusted network
  pulse`). Weak network activity alone is insufficient.
- An unconfirmed dispatch pauses as `SEND-002`; the user must reconcile it.
  Ghost never resends an ambiguous prompt.
- Crash recovery preserves an in-flight/uncertain journal and performs no
  automatic replay.
- A claim/yield/re-read lease closes the empty-lock multi-tab race immediately
  before the actuator runs.

### One canonical product source

- Removed the divergent `dev/` product and duplicate test tree.
- `ghost-in-the-loop.user.js` is canonical.
- `scripts/build-extension.js` deterministically generates
  `extension/content.js`; `npm run check:generated` and CI reject drift.
- Jest is scoped to the canonical `tests/` tree. CI no longer double-counts
  duplicated suites or publishes meaningless zero-coverage output.

### Redacted, useful failure reports

- Stable codes cover boot, composer, Send, export, and sentinel failures.
- A bounded local incident record keeps stage, platform key, version, state,
  health, adapter results, and timing metadata.
- Reports omit prompt/message content, full URLs, query strings, conversation
  identifiers, task identifiers, and raw network payloads.
- Users review locally, then copy or download. Opening GitHub sends only a title;
  report contents are never auto-uploaded.
- The independent canary now produces privacy-safe codes and a downloadable
  execution report for the “script never ran” case that core cannot self-report.

### Truthful export contract

- Transcript exports return `complete`, `partial`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.
- Platform archive exports compare captured and expected supported turns and
  flag omitted or unsupported parts.
- DOM exports are always `partial` because rendered/lazy-loaded history cannot
  prove completeness.
- Markdown embeds source, counts, status, and validation notes.
  `gitl.transcript.v1` JSON embeds the same `gitl.export-result.v1` contract.
- Cancel aborts the live archive request and does not create a file.
- A failed/empty capture creates local `EXPORT-001` diagnostics instead of
  claiming success.

### Imports and rendering are transactional

- Config backups use exact `gitl.config.v1`; only bounded settings are accepted.
  Project/task text, custom sites, community content, and diagnostics remain in
  their purpose-specific formats.
- Workshop imports require exact `gitl-workshop/1`, reject unknown fields, and
  validate the entire bundle before mutation.
- Config and Workshop persistence roll back on commit failure.
- Imported/project/queue/diagnostic values are escaped at HTML-rendering sinks,
  with injection regression coverage.

### Capsule and UI corrections

- Capsule v2 moved to **Export → Advanced** and is labeled experimental.
- It preserves legitimate repeats and short turns; hashes are integrity hints,
  not deduplication authority.
- It omits the full URL, states `import_supported:false`, and makes no resumable
  claim.
- **Pause** and **Stop** are always text-labeled. Stop preserves progress; Reset
  remains a separate Advanced action.
- Panel drag handlers bind once with Pointer Events instead of accumulating two
  document listeners on every render.

### Verification

- 28 Jest suites, **371 tests**, including new send-transaction, export-contract,
  config-import, Workshop rollback, redaction, generated-source, and HTML
  escaping regressions.
- Playwright remains the authoritative boot-timing/browser tier in GitHub
  Actions for Chromium and Firefox.
- The first PR run correctly exposed two stale v8.1 browser assertions that
  expected generic pages to auto-authorize Send-looking buttons. The fixtures
  now lock the v8.3 contract: generic remains manual; an explicit reviewed
  selector authorizes the real control; popup/copy traps still lose in both
  engines.

## [8.2.1] — send-target mislearn fix (issues #4, #5)

Two field reports showed the self-healing SelectorMemory learning the **wrong**
send control and then "sending" by clicking it:

- **#5 (Grok)** learned `#model-select-trigger` — the model-picker dropdown.
- **#4 (ChatGPT)** learned `#composer-plus-btn` — the "+" attach menu.

Root cause: both controls sit *inside the composer form*, so the heuristic
tier's "same-form" positive signal alone qualified them as a send button, and
nothing inspected their `id` or the fact that they open a menu. The loop then
"sent" by opening a dropdown, and the run stalled with *"No output detected."*

### ✅ Structural popup-toggle veto
`_sendLooksSafe` now rejects any candidate carrying `aria-haspopup` or
`aria-expanded` — a send button submits, it never opens a menu or toggles a
disclosure. This one check kills both field mislearns regardless of wording.

### ✅ id folded into the veto surface
The element `id` was never inspected before. It is now part of the label the
veto runs against, and `SEND_VETO` gained `model|plus|tool|option|picker|
dropdown|emoji|format`, so `#model-select-trigger` and `#composer-plus-btn`
read as unsafe by name alone.

### ✅ One veto gate for every tier
`_heurSend` now routes its veto through `_sendLooksSafe` (single source of
truth) instead of a private inline check, so the id + structural rules apply in
the heuristic tier too. A persisted wrong selector also self-heals:
`SelectorMemory.lookup('send')` already forgets a stored selector that fails
`_sendLooksSafe`, so existing poisoned memory is dropped on next lookup.

Send itself was never solely dependent on the button: the pipeline verifies the
input actually cleared and falls through Enter → insertParagraph → form-submit,
so vetoing a bad button degrades to those tiers rather than failing.

New regression suite: `tests/mislearn.test.js`.

## [8.2.0] — RELIABILITY OVERHAUL (post-Gemini hardening)

With the Gemini root cause fixed in 8.1.5 (Trusted Types), this release works
through the highest-value items from the failure audit — the ones that address
*confirmed* weaknesses — while deliberately NOT rewriting working code on spec.

### ✅ Tests now run in Firefox, not just Chromium
The whole Gemini saga went undiagnosed for weeks because every e2e ran in
Chromium while the field failure was Firefox Android — so Trusted Types
enforcement was never exercised. Playwright now runs the full suite in **both
Chromium and Firefox** (Gecko), and CI installs both. The Firefox project uses
a mobile viewport + Android UA to approximate the reporter's device; it's
desktop Gecko, not GeckoView, so treat passes as Gecko-validated, not
Android-certified. Immediate payoff: the v8.1.5 Trusted Types fix is now
**confirmed in real Gecko**, and Firefox caught a timing-flaky test on day one.

### ✅ Transactional boot — one failing subsystem can't blank the panel
Boot was a straight-line block: a throw in any step before the panel mounted
(even an optional subsystem) aborted everything, and `__GITL_V8__` was committed
before boot even ran, so a failed attempt permanently blocked a retry. Boot now
runs as isolated phases: **critical** (styles → panel → render) fail loud;
**optional** (continue-observer, heartbeat, tab-lock, bus, sentinel, boot-retry)
are each caught and only degrade health (`GHOST._degraded`, Timeline
`boot_phase`, `console … degraded:`). The singleton commits only after the panel
is up.

### ✅ Bounded, visibility-aware panel sentinel
The 8.1.4 remount watchdog only checked *absence* and was unbounded — a page
that re-hid the panel could drive an infinite append/remove storm. The sentinel
now also rescues a panel that's been moved into a `display:none`/`hidden`/
zero-size subtree, **caps** remounts (5 per 30s), and on exceeding the cap
**opens a circuit breaker** with a visible note instead of thrashing. (Safe
because Ghost never hides its own root — collapse only hides the inner body.)

### ✅ Independent execution canary (`diagnostics/gitl-canary.user.js`)
A standalone userscript, separate from core, that answers the one thing Ghost's
own beacon can't: *did the manager execute a userscript here at all?* Badge but
no panel → Ghost's fault; neither → manager/injection layer. Shadow-DOM host on
`<html>`, built with DOM APIs (no innerHTML), so it's safe even on Trusted-Types
pages. See `diagnostics/README.md`.

### Deliberately deferred (honest scope)
Two audit phases were **not** done, on purpose: a capability-split Gemini
adapter rewrite (Phase 4) and a packaging/manager matrix + WXT build (Phase 6).
Both touch working code or are large process/build efforts with low marginal
value now that the actual bug is fixed and the adapter already has the
send-veto + selector-memory hardening from 8.1.1. They're recorded in DEVLOG as
future work rather than half-implemented.

**303 unit + 52 e2e (26 × Chromium + 26 × Firefox), all green.**

## [8.1.5] — GEMINI ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED (Trusted Types)

### 🎯 The actual cause — and the v8.1.4 banner is what caught it
On the reporter's phone the v8.1.4 fail-loud banner read, on Gemini:
> Element.innerHTML setter: **Sink type mismatch violation blocked by CSP**

That is a **Trusted Types** violation. Gemini (a Google property) enforces
`require-trusted-types-for 'script'` in its CSP. Under that policy, assigning a
plain string to `.innerHTML` **throws** — and GITL builds its panel from
`.innerHTML` templates, so the first render in the boot path threw and killed
boot before the panel could mount. **This is exactly why it was Gemini-only:**
no other supported platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok…)
enforces Trusted Types, so raw `.innerHTML` worked everywhere else. It was never
a selector, a network hook, or a manager problem — every earlier guess was wrong.

### The fix
GITL now registers one Trusted Types policy (`gitl-ui`) at boot and routes its
**four** `.innerHTML` sinks through it. On any site that does NOT enforce Trusted
Types, the policy is never created and the wrapper returns the raw string —
**byte-identical behaviour off Gemini, zero regression risk.** GITL only ever
passes its own static templates through the policy (imported persona/workflow
text is already escaped via `_esc` upstream), so it adds no injection surface.

### Verified for real this time
A new Chromium e2e loads the actual userscript on a page that genuinely enforces
Trusted Types (`tests/e2e/trustedtypes.spec.js` + `mock-chat-tt.html`) and proves
three things: (1) the fixture really enforces TT — a raw `innerHTML` throws;
(2) v8.1.5 mounts `#gitl` anyway; (3) if a restrictive `trusted-types` allow-list
were to block our policy, boot still fails LOUD (banner + error beacon), never a
blank page. **Honest scope:** this is verified under Trusted Types enforcement in
a real browser engine; final confirmation on the reporter's Firefox-Android +
authenticated Gemini still rests with them — but the error it fixes is the exact
one their device reported.

## [8.1.4] — FAIL-LOUD BOOT + PANEL SELF-HEAL (Gemini diagnosis)

### The honest status
v8.1.3 was **confirmed installed and active** on the reporter's phone (Tampermonkey
dashboard showed Version 8.1.3, enabled, matched on Gemini) and the panel STILL
never entered the DOM — Gemini only; it mounts fine on other sites on the same
device. So the v8.1.3 network-interceptor fix, though a real bug fix, was NOT the
cause of this symptom. This release does not *claim* to fix Gemini — it makes the
failure **diagnosable and self-healing**, because a static page-save plus a mobile
console that only forwards one cross-origin-masked error can't say why boot fails.

### 🔦 Boot beacon (works in a plain "save page" capture)
`<html data-gitl-boot="…">` is written at each phase: `started` the instant the
script runs, `ok:<ver>` once the panel is mounted, or `error:<stage>` if boot
throws. A basic page save now reveals whether the script executed at all and how
far it got — the single most useful signal, since that's the artifact we can get.

### 📣 Fail-loud (no more silent death)
The whole IIFE body is wrapped so ANY top-level throw — not just the network
interceptor (there's a lot of pre-boot code: state build, crash recovery, history
patching) — routes to `_gitlFatal()`: a `GM_notification` **and** a fixed banner
injected at `documentElement` level (not `body`, which may be the missing/hostile
thing). Previously such a throw died silently and `lastBootError` was invisible
because the panel that displays it never mounted. Now you SEE the error and can
screenshot it.

### 🔁 Panel self-heal
A watchdog re-mounts `#gitl` if the page framework removes it. Gemini's Angular
shell is unusually aggressive about owning `document.body`, and a full re-render
can wipe the panel out with no error thrown — a leading suspect for "installed and
active but nothing shows up." Re-mount is logged (`panel_remount`) and reflected on
the beacon (`remounted:N`).

Verified in real Chromium: successful-boot beacon, a forced boot-throw showing the
banner + `error:boot` beacon + persisted error, and panel re-mount after removal
(`tests/e2e/bootdiag.spec.js`).

## [8.1.3] — GEMINI SILENT BOOT CRASH

### 🐞 FIX — Ghost "doesn't seem to load" on Gemini (and any page with a hardened window.fetch)
No error, no panel, nothing — the worst kind of bug. A full-page capture of the
live Gemini tab (SingleFile, which does capture other extensions' live DOM
injections — Grammarly showed up fine) proved `#gitl` never mounted at all.
Not a selector problem: the panel was never created.

**Root cause:** `GITL_NET.install()` runs at module top-level, *outside*
`safeBoot()`'s try/catch (which only wraps panel creation, much further
down). It did three **unguarded** strict-mode property writes —
`window.fetch =`, `XHR.prototype.open =`, `XHR.prototype.send =`. If a page
has hardened any of those (`Object.defineProperty(..., {writable:false})` —
a real pattern on security-conscious sites, plausible on a Google property),
the assignment throws a TypeError right there, and because nothing catches
it, the **entire script dies** before a single line of panel code runs.
Confirmed by reproducing it: froze `window.fetch` before injecting the real
script in a test browser — panel failed to mount, exactly as reported.

**Fix:** every patch (fetch, XHR open, XHR send, WebSocket) is now
individually try/catched, the whole `install()` method has an outer
catch-all, and the top-level call site is guarded too. A hardened site now
just loses that one piece of network telemetry — the panel, loop engine,
and everything else boot completely normally. Verified with the same
frozen-property reproduction now passing, for `fetch`, `XHR.send`, and
both at once.

### Prior boot failures are no longer invisible
`lastBootError` was already being written to GM storage on a crash — but
nothing ever read it back. Now, on the next successful boot, a stored prior
failure surfaces once into Diagnostics (and therefore into any auto-report)
and clears, instead of silently expiring in storage where no one could ever
see why a previous load failed.

## [8.1.2] — TWO FIELD REPORTS CLOSED

### 🐞 FIX — Grok run paused itself 1 second after a perfectly good send (issue #2)
`send_ok` at 14:34:05, `"Route changed — paused"` at 14:34:06. Grok (like most
chat platforms) assigns the conversation a `/c/<uuid>` URL the instant the
FIRST message goes out — that's the same conversation continuing, not real
navigation, but the route watcher paused any running loop on ANY URL change.
- The watcher now only pauses when the route change looks like a genuine
  navigation away: different hostname, **or** nothing was sent in the last
  15s to explain the URL move. A same-host URL change right after a send is
  now just logged (`route_id_assigned`) and the loop keeps running.
- Element caches are still cleared on every route change either way — a
  same-host ID assignment can still remount the composer.

### 🐞 FIX — Perplexity Deep Research paused mid-thought with "No output detected" (issue #1)
Sent fine (`send_ok`), then two re-fires, then paused ~35s later even though
Perplexity was still visibly "thinking" — Deep Research can run silently for
minutes with **zero assistant DOM nodes yet**, not just no new growth.
- d13 already taught the *later* no-signal branch to hold its stale counter
  while `Adapter.isGenerating()` is true (network/stop-button witness) and
  use each platform's `staleTicks` budget instead of a flat 5. That fix
  never reached the *earlier* "no text exists yet" branch, which is exactly
  what fires before Deep Research's first message container appears — so
  slow-starting platforms could still pause ~12s after a good send.
- Same treatment applied here: hold the counter while generating, use the
  per-platform budget (Perplexity: 24 ticks).

Both reproduced as real-browser Playwright tests before and after the fix
(`tests/e2e/routefix.spec.js`, `tests/issuefixes.test.js`).

## [8.1.1] — SELF-HEALING BASE

### 🐞 FIX — DeepSeek clicked "Copy" instead of Send (field report)
The heuristic send-finder scored ANY icon button near the composer (svg icon +1,
proximity +3 = past the 3.5 threshold), so DeepSeek's message "Copy" button won
and the prompt got copied instead of sent.
- **Semantic gate:** a candidate now needs a POSITIVE send signal (send word in
  its label, `type=submit`, or same `<form>` as the composer). Icon + proximity
  alone can never win again.
- **Veto list expanded** to every message-action verb: copy, download, share,
  edit, delete, regenerate, retry, like/dislike, read-aloud, translate, DeepThink…
- **The veto now guards EVERY tier** — configured selectors and learned selectors
  pass through `_sendLooksSafe()` too, so a rotted `div[class*="send"]` match
  can't hand back a share widget.

### 🐞 FIX — Models that don't echo the sigil stranded the loop ("No signal detected")
DeepSeek (and some custom GPTs) answer fully but never print `[[GITL::PROCEED]]`.
The run used to hard-pause after ~12 s of quiet.
- **Sigil-free completion fallback:** when a reply finishes (generation ended,
  text stable) with no sigil, Ghost now auto-continues ONCE with a protocol
  reminder, and only pauses after **2 consecutive** sigil-free replies.
  Every nudge still consumes a round, so drift guard / round limit keep their grip.
- Streak resets the moment a real PROCEED/HALT arrives.
- Fixed a latent crash: `Timeline.add()` (no such method) in the roadmap re-ask path.

### 🔄 Re-detect actually finds the box now (field report: "refresh sometimes fails")
Re-detect was one-shot — pressed at the exact moment an SPA is mid-remount, it
missed and told you to try again.
- **Keeps watching for 12 s** after a miss (MutationObserver + interval); reports
  success the moment the composer appears, with a spinning 🔄 the whole time.
- Clears **all** element caches now (the heuristic tier's 4 s cache was missed before).
- Resets stale network stream counters (aborted background XHRs could fake
  "still generating" after an app-switch).
- One-time gentle focus nudge for editors that only mount their composer on focus
  (never steals focus if you're typing somewhere).
- **Silent self-heal:** returning to the tab with a detached cached composer now
  drops caches automatically — most manual 🔄 presses just disappear.

### 🧠 NEW — Selector Memory (self-healing locators)
The industry-standard tier GITL was missing (Healenium-style): when configured
selectors fail but the role/meaning heuristic finds the element, Ghost derives a
STABLE selector from it (id > data-testid > aria-label > name > placeholder) —
verified unique — and remembers it per-host. Next session tries the learned
selector right after the configured ones, so a site redesign pays the heuristic
cost once and the fix survives reloads. Capped at 12 hosts, self-pruning,
learned send-selectors are veto-checked.

### ⚠ Reporter — deduped + deeper
- Identical auto-captures within 10 min no longer rebuild/re-send duplicates
  (the `_seen` dedupe was declared in v7.1 but never wired).
- Reports now include learned-selector state for the host.
- 🔍 Probe selectors now shows all three tiers: configured / learned / heuristic.

### 🌐 Workshop — share does the work now
- **Share button** copies a paste-ready GitHub Discussions post: item list +
  the full `.gitl.json` bundle in a code block. Then opens the how-to.
- **Skins ride in the bundle:** exporting includes your active custom skin
  (validated tokens only); importing a bundle with a skin applies it. A single
  file now shares a complete look-and-brains pack. Skin-only bundles are valid.
- Import stays additive-only: built-ins immutable, clashes auto-rename,
  invalid skins skipped, never fatal.

## [8.0.0.13] — DEV BUILD d13

### 🐞 FIX — Perplexity paused itself mid-thought ("No signal detected")
Field report: Perplexity Deep Research, round 1, `stop: NO MATCH`, watchdog 45 s stale, run paused. Root cause: Perplexity's long "Thinking" phase produces **no DOM growth and no stop button** for minutes, so the 5-stale-tick counter tripped and paused a run that was working perfectly.
- The stale counter is now **held while `Adapter.isGenerating()` is true** — the d7 network channel is the only honest witness during a silent think phase (no text yet, no stop button, but bytes are flowing). Status shows `🧠 Model is still working…`
- Per-platform `staleTicks` budget; Perplexity gets **24** (was a flat 5)
- Perplexity `stop` selectors widened with `aria-label*` / `data-testid*` contains-fallbacks

### Collapsed dock readout was unreadable ("R1 / 24 / 25 / ↻")
Now a real **mini progress bar** + `3/7` step count, with the drift budget as a labelled `24 left` chip (tap the number to change the limit, ↻ to reset) instead of bare digits.

### Run tab is an interface again, not a sheet of text
Restructured into **modules** — each function is its own bordered unit with an icon header strip and a live value on the right, rather than undifferentiated stacked rows:
- 🎛 **Transport** — ▶ ⏸ ⊕, with run state in the header
- 📊 **Progress** — bar, step count, drift guard; % in the header
- Advanced ▾ → 🧭 **Strategy** · 🧠 **Thinking**

**Strategy moved into Advanced** as requested: the basic Run view is now exactly transport + progress + drift. Everything else is one tap away. Module chrome is token-driven, so all 13 skins restyle it automatically; header strips are 8.5 px and 3 px tall, so the density gate holds.


## [8.0.0.12] — DEV BUILD d12

### 🌙 Unattended mode — background runs actually work now
Reported: "I press start, leave the tab, come back and nothing happened." Correct — and it was **two** separate blockers, one of them deliberate:

1. **GITL's own focus guard.** `assertInteractionSafe()` runs before every `engineSend` and returns `tab-not-focused` the instant `document.hasFocus()` goes false. Comment in the source: *"prevents background tabs from burning tokens by auto-sending prompts while user isn't looking."* Working as designed — just not what you wanted.
2. **Browser timer throttling.** Hidden tabs throttle `setInterval` to roughly once a minute, so even without the guard the 2.5 s engine loop would crawl.

**Fix — new opt-in `🌙 Unattended` toggle in Setup (default OFF):**
- Relaxes the *focus* half of the guard only. The **tab lock is never relaxed** — two tabs still can't drive the same conversation. Drift guard and round limits still apply as runaway backstops.
- Swaps the engine loop onto a **Web Worker ticker**, which browsers don't throttle the way they throttle hidden-tab `setInterval`. Strict page CSP (ChatGPT's, notably) can refuse `blob:` workers — so it falls back to `setInterval` automatically and reports which path is live in Diagnostics (`| Unattended | ON · ticker:worker |`) rather than failing silently.
- Honest scope, stated in the UI and help: **the tab must stay open.** This keeps a background tab running; it does not move the run to a server. Closing the browser still ends the run.

`tests/unattended.test.js` covers guard-on/guard-off semantics, the tab-lock still firing under unattended, and the CSP fallback path.


## [8.0.0.11] — DEV BUILD d11

### 🐞 MAJOR BUG FIX — personas, posture and strategy were never reaching the model
Reported from the field: arm a committee in the Personas tab, hit **▶ Run with committee**, and the model just gets `Continue.` — no personas, no Think First, no posture. Confirmed in code.

**Root cause:** the directive block (persona + strategy payload + posture clause) was assembled on exactly ONE code path — "user typed a fresh prompt into the composer." Every other way to start a run silently dropped it:
- Run from the Personas tab (composer empty) → fell through to the resume path → bare `RESUME_TEXT`
- Resume an existing conversation → bare `RESUME_TEXT`
- Un-pause → the tick loop sent a bare `Continue`

So unless you re-typed your task from scratch every single time, **nothing you configured was ever sent.** The settings applied locally and were rendered in the panel, which is why it looked like they were on.

**Fix:** new `runDirectives()` builder + a once-per-run `persona._delivered` flag, honored by *every* entry path — typed prompt, existing-chat resume, un-pause, and mid-run persona changes. Delivered exactly once per run (not re-sent every turn), re-armed when the run ends or the selection changes. Roadmap resumes omit the strategy payload so a resume can't request a brand-new roadmap mid-run.
`tests/directives.test.js` locks the contract shut, including a direct replay of the reported 6-persona committee flow.

### Export tab — sunken row list (user request)
The four export actions are now divided rows in a sunken well: icon button on the left, **bold name** + small description on the right, each row edge-colored by role (Export=accent, Capsule=muted, Handoff=ok-green, Backup Handoff=warn-amber). All four ids and listeners unchanged. Style is token-driven, so every skin restyles it automatically.

### "Emergency Handoff" → "Backup Handoff" (user feedback: "emergency" oversells it)
Calmer wording, still clearly Handoff's lighter sibling rather than a separate escalation. Renamed everywhere: button, explain-mode entry, tab guide, generated file header/footer, filename slug (`backup-handoff`), and `exportBackupHandoff()`.

### 4 new skins, reverse-engineered from the reference UI kits
Built purely from the existing token + fx vocabulary — no new engine capability, so they're all expressible as community `.gitl.json` files too:
- **HUD** — sci-fi cyan wireframe: near-black ground, hairline cyan rules, flickering ghost, EKG progress
- **Nova** — glossy pink/violet AI-dashboard glass: aurora ring, halo ghost, pill tabs, shimmer fill
- **Ion** — brushed-metal media-deck: bezeled surfaces, teal LED accent, sheen
- **Flow** — calm flat navy dashboard: pill tabs, minimal motion

**Accent color picker:** six one-tap color swatches beside the hue slider — pick a color directly instead of hunting for it on the slider. Works on every preset (13 built-ins now) and on custom skins.


## [8.0.0.10] — DEV BUILD d10

### Renamed "Rescue" → "Emergency Handoff" (user feedback: it sounded bigger than Export, not smaller)
It's the lightweight sibling of Handoff, not a rival to Export. New three-way framing, consistent everywhere (button, explain-mode entry, tab guide, export-tab hint, filename slug, generated file header/footer):
- **Export** — the full record. Biggest of the three; for keeping, not resuming.
- **Handoff** — the AI writes its own briefing, chat still alive. Fullest way to resume.
- **Emergency Handoff** *(was Rescue)* — Ghost writes a lighter briefing when the chat is DEAD and can't write its own: state snapshot + last 10 messages verbatim. Deliberately smaller than Export — use only when Handoff isn't possible.

No functional change — `exportRescue()` renamed to `exportEmergencyHandoff()`, output filename slug `rescue` → `emergency-handoff`, button id (`#g-rescue`) and all wiring left untouched.


## [8.0.0.9] — DEV BUILD d9

### Run tab: basic vs Advanced (user feedback)
The Thinking-posture picker moved under **Advanced ▾** — the default Run view is now just Strategy → transport (▶ ⏸ ⊕) → progress. Advanced holds: posture, injected-prompt preview, End & reset. The footer status line still shows the active posture at all times.

### Posture terminology (user feedback: "Extended sounds like less")
Labels renamed so each says what it does — no false strength ladder. Storage keys and model-facing clauses unchanged (old saves keep working):
- **Standard → Locked** — exact declared plan, no additions
- **Evolving → Adaptive** — the plan may GROW mid-run when a justified blocker/gap forces it
- **Extended → Audit** — locked plan, then ONE end-of-run gap review that closes only material holes

### 🔎 Explain mode (tap-anything FAQ)
New ⓘ button beside the tab ?. Tap ⓘ, then tap ANY control — a one-breath description appears and the click is swallowed (nothing activates). Registry-driven (`EXPLAIN`), 23 entries covering transport, drift guard, strategy, postures (dynamic from `POSTURES`), skins, hue, exports, tabs; graceful fallback pointing to the tab ? guide. Capture-phase intercept on the panel root; survives re-renders.

### Export clarity (user question: rescue vs full export)
Button microcopy now self-distinguishes: **⬇ full export** = the complete archival transcript · **🤝 Handoff — AI briefs the next chat (chat alive)** · **🛟 Rescue — resume a DEAD chat elsewhere** (state snapshot + roadmap position + last 10 verbatim messages + resume instructions). Explain mode carries the long-form answers.

### Tests
`tests/explain.test.js` (registry integrity, live-panel lookup, dynamic posture resolution, null fallback); posture label assertions updated.


## [8.0.0.8] — DEV BUILD d8

### Field-report fixes (first live d7 telemetry, ChatGPT mobile / Firefox Android)
- **Roadmap auto-recovery:** when Autopilot gets a PROCEED but no `[[GITL::ROADMAP]]` block (Scholar GPT self-tracked "[Step 1 of 7]" instead), GITL now sends ONE automatic format re-request — "output only the roadmap block, don't redo the research" — before pausing. Timeline event `roadmap_reask` logged.
- **Tier-memory bug:** the stored send path `btn-3+enter+paragraph+form` contains "btn" even when the button tier *failed*, so the 1-attempt fast path never engaged. Now only a pure `btn-N` path (button actually worked) keeps 3 attempts.
- **Heuristic finder caching:** results memoized 4 s (element-liveness checked) — the report showed full DOM re-scans on every health tick while paused.
- **ChatGPT selectors widened:** `data-testid*="send"/"submit"/"stop"` + `aria-label*="Stop"` contains-fallbacks appended (probe showed all exact selectors missing; note: on mobile the send button legitimately doesn't exist while the composer is empty — the voice button occupies that slot).

### Skins get their effects back (state-aware, per recovered design sessions)
Restored the effect vocabulary from the approved design language — **effects are data-driven but core-implemented**: five enumerated fx axes a skin selects from, all Firefox-safe (`transform`/`opacity`/`background-position` only, no `@property`), all honoring `prefers-reduced-motion`, and all **state-aware**: lively while RUNNING, slow subtle ambient while idle (the approved Floating-Glass behavior — `render()` now sets `data-run` on the panel).
- `border`: `aurora` (drifting 3-stop gradient ring) · `glow` (breathing accent inlay idle → tracing light when running)
- `ghost` (the 👻 glyph, now its own `.g-ghost` span — real emoji, never redrawn): `float` · `flicker` (neon) · `halo` (pulsing accent drop-shadow) · `glow`
- `tabs` (paint-only restyle of the same buttons): `underline` (glow strip under active) · `pill`
- `progress`: `shimmer` (flowing accent fill) · `ekg` (heartbeat sweep across the track)
- `surface`: `sheen` (slow specular band)

Every preset now has a distinct vocabulary, not just a palette: Aurora (aurora border + float + underline + shimmer + sheen), Neon (tracing glow border + flicker ghost + pill tabs + EKG), Liquid (aurora + sheen + halo + shimmer), OLED (glow border + glowing ghost + EKG), Glass (halo + sheen + underline), Metal (sheen + pill), Clay (float + pill), Paper (underline), Classic (clean baseline). Community skins pick any combination via `fx` — still zero structural power, still forward-compatible.


## [8.0.0.7] — DEV BUILD d7

### Network channel actually works now (dual-channel generation detection)
**Bug found by live-repo audit:** `GITL_NET` patched the *sandbox* `window.fetch` — with `@grant GM_*`, Tampermonkey isolates the script, so the page's real requests never crossed the hook and the whole network layer was dead in production (it only ever worked inside the jsdom test harness). Fixed by targeting `unsafeWindow` (new `@grant unsafeWindow`; Firefox MV3 port note: inject in `world:"MAIN"`).
- **Trusted channel:** known chat endpoints (list refreshed — added Gemini's current `batchexecute` streaming transport) still parse SSE chunks
- **Heuristic channel (platform-proof):** any same-origin POST stream or `text/event-stream` response pulses a timestamp — content never read or stored; analytics/telemetry URLs excluded. Heuristic pulses only count inside a 2-minute post-send expectation window, so background streams can't fake "generating"
- **XHR upgraded:** `loadstart`/`progress`/`loadend` pulses (Gemini streams over XHR), plus a WebSocket message pulse (Perplexity socket.io)
- **Wired into the engine:** `Adapter.isGenerating()` = stop-button OR `GITL_NET.streaming()`; the v7.1 send-confirmation watchdog therefore confirms sends from network traffic even when a redesign removes the stop button. DOM stays authoritative; net is additive (technique studied in LightSession & KeepChatGPT, re-implemented clean-room — both hook page `fetch` in production)

### Heuristic element finders (final fallback tier)
When every configured selector fails — e.g. Gemini's May-2026 full redesign (pill composer, relocated controls) — GITL now locates the composer and send button by **role and meaning** (Playwright-style): `role=textbox`/contenteditable scoring for input; aria-label/title/testid matched against a 13-language send dictionary, `type=submit`, form kinship, and proximity for the button, with a veto list (voice/mic/attach/search/stop). Engaged only when selector arrays come up empty; DIAG-noted when it fires.

### Send chain — two new buttonless tiers + tier memory
- Tier 4 verify added to `insertParagraph`; **Tier 5: `form.requestSubmit()`** — native submission that survives any button redesign
- **ClipboardEvent paste tier** in `injectText` for editors that ignore execCommand and synthetic input (some Lexical builds)
- **Tier memory:** the winning send path is remembered per host (`sendTier:<host>`); if the button tier failed last time, only 1 button attempt is made before falling through (~1.8 s faster recovery on broken sites)

### Smoother load
180 ms panel entrance animation replaces the pop-in (animation-only; ends at natural state — zero behavioral surface).

### Skins — 3 trend presets + easier modding (now 9 built-ins)
- **Liquid** — liquid-glass: translucent rgba surfaces, 16 px blur, icy animated gradient border (Apple iOS-26-lineage trend)
- **OLED** — dark-first true-black: hairline borders instead of shadows, vivid accent (2026 dark-first/OLED trend)
- **Paper** — the first light preset, warm paper tones (enabled by tokenizing the remaining `#fff/#666/#444/#333` text literals → `--g-text-hot/-low/-faint/-ghost`)
- **Easy modding loop:** ⬆ import / ⬇ export now always visible — pick any preset, export, edit the JSON, re-import. Hue slider gains double-click-to-reset + tooltip. New `docs/SKINS.md` authoring guide.

### Tests
`tests/net-heur.test.js` (streaming semantics, heuristic gating, `_maybeChat` filters, finder scoring/veto/own-UI exclusion); structure-test network invariants updated to the corrected page-world form; suite green.


## [8.0.0.6] — DEV BUILD d6

### Skin engine — tokens, not code (Committee-approved architecture)
Skins are now **data**: a whitelisted set of CSS custom properties (colors, radius, shadow, font, blur, aurora stops) plus two enumerated fx flags (`border: aurora`, `ghost: float`) applied to the panel root. Core owns all structure and behavior — a skin **cannot** add, remove, hide, or restructure controls, and cannot execute anything (no selectors, no `url()`, no CSS text; JSON only). Unknown tokens/fx are silently dropped, so community skins are forward- and backward-compatible across GITL versions.
- ~160 hardcoded hex literals in core CSS replaced with `var(--g-*)`; Classic defaults equal the previous values, so Classic renders pixel-identical
- 6 built-in presets: Classic, Aurora (violet glass + animated gradient border, Firefox-safe `background-position` animation), Glass, Metal, Neon, Clay — all expressed in the same token format as user skins (dogfooding)
- Custom skin import/export as `.gitl.json` (`kind:"skin"`) with ⬆/⬇ buttons in Setup; 8 KB cap, value blacklist (`url(`, braces, `@import`, `javascript:`), name sanitization — mirrors Workshop safety rules
- Accent hue slider now real: rotates the active skin's four accent tokens (preserving each token's saturation/lightness); untouched slider = skin's native hue. Stored `skinTheme:'new'` migrates to `'aurora'`
- New GM key `customSkin`; `SKIN.apply()` runs at boot after `mountPanel()`
- Tests: `tests/skin.test.js` (validator security, forward-compat drops, preset integrity, hue math, apply/clear behavior)
## [8.0.0.5] — DEV BUILD d5

### UX restructure
- **Strategy dropdown** replaces Loop/Think/Roadmap buttons (Step by step / Plan first / Autopilot)
- **Basic/advanced split** on Run tab — posture, prompt preview, and End button behind Advanced ▾
- **Personas tab** (was Roles) — single-select with preview, committee toggle, multi-persona builder, per-task and final-review toggles
- **Detection status line** — shows platform · strategy · posture · round below status bar
- **Drift guard** on/off toggle + inline editable counter
- **Skin selector** + accent hue slider in Setup (plumbing only, no skins yet)

### Committee pipeline (engine)
- `resolvePersonaInject()` supports array selection + committee framing
- Per-task injection in engineTick proceed path + roadmap steps
- Post-halt final review hook — committee reviews before engineHalt
- Migration shim: persona string→array backward compatible

### SPA reliability
- `@noframes` prevents double-injection in iframes
- SPA boot retry: 30s element finder for late-rendering apps
- Gemini: custom element selectors, scroll guard restricted to infinite-scroller
- ChatGPT: data-testid fallback selectors
- Perplexity: [data-testid=composer], role=textbox fallbacks

### Three-stage send failsafe (from MCP-SuperAssistant research)
- Stage 1: button.click() → verify input cleared
- Stage 2: Enter key with composed:true (crosses Shadow DOM)
- Stage 3: insertParagraph beforeinput (ProseMirror/Lexical native)
- `composed:true` on all synthetic keyboard + input events
- Grok: comprehensive selector update

### Collapsed dock redesign
- Width 32→44px, touch targets 36×36px
- Drift guard editable in dock strip with ↻ reset
- Hide 🔄 and ? when collapsed

## [8.0.0] — DEV BUILD (features complete, UI reskin pending)

> Working build. Not pushed. Items below are locked + unit-tested unless marked ⏳ unfinished.

### Send-confirmation watchdog (fixes mobile stuck-screen)
A send was previously assumed successful the instant the button was clicked / Enter pressed. If a notification stole focus at that exact moment (`assertInteractionSafe` blocks on `!document.hasFocus()`), the keystroke could be swallowed and the loop would sit parked forever. Now, after every send, generation must actually begin — `Adapter.isGenerating()` true OR output text grows — within `SEND_CONFIRM_MS` (9s). If not, the send re-fires up to `SEND_MAX_RETRIES` (2) before pausing with a captured report. New helpers: `_onSendOk`, `_confirmSend`, `_refireSend`; confirmation branch at top of `engineTick`.

### Round limit → soft checkpoint (fixes "stopped short at 19/20")
Root cause of the early-stop reports: `maxRounds` (default 20) hard-paused a chat that was legitimately running longer (e.g. to 24). The cap now pauses in a dedicated `LIMIT` state instead of stranding the run — *"Hit 20 auto-continues — still going. ▶ to run 20 more."* One tap (expanded panel, collapsed mini-bar, or Alt+P, all via new `primaryAction()` dispatcher) extends the cap by one increment and resumes. Asks again every increment, so a runaway loop still can't burn tokens unattended. New: `engineLimit()`, `extendLimit()`, `LIMIT` state in status/mini-bar with pulsing ▶.

### Reporter module (zero embedded credentials)
Structured trouble reports assembled automatically on send-unconfirmed, early stalls, and probe failures; plus a manual "⚠ Report a problem" button. Pluggable transport: clipboard copy (default), pre-filled GitHub issue URL (one tap, no login-as-maintainer), and a drop-in `REPORT_WORKER_URL` slot for a future silent relay. No write token is ever shipped in the script. In-panel banner with 📋 Copy / ↗ Open issue.

### Flow tab — usability rebuild
Previously a dead end on mobile: select a workflow, see "Reset", no ▶, no guidance, tapping a stage did nothing. Now: a ▶ Start workflow button on the tab itself, plain-language "how this works," per-stage vertical INSERT buttons (drop one stage's prompt into the chat box manually), and ▶ Start respects the Pause-between toggle (required for Lens Relay model-swapping). New: `startWorkflow()`, `insertPrompt()`.

### Per-tab help icons
Each tab gets a small `?` that deep-links to that tab's help section, with a back button that returns to the originating tab. New `TAB_HELP` map, `prevTab` state.

### Workshop — community content (custom personas & workflows)
Create custom personas (Roles) and workflows (Flow), each with a ★ badge and tap-twice delete. Export all custom items to one shareable `.gitl.json` bundle; import others' bundles additively (built-ins immutable, custom-id clashes auto-rename). Shared Import/Export/Share row in both tabs; Share deep-links to GitHub Discussions + `workshop`-tagged issue submission. Safeties: 512 KB/200-item caps, field truncation, per-item validation, and `_esc()` markup-injection guard on all custom text. New `Workshop` module + `allPersonas()`/`allWorkflows()` merge accessors. Covered by 17 new unit tests (`tests/workshop.test.js`).

### ⏳ Unfinished in this build (do not release until done)
- Evolving / Extended thinking-posture prompts (synthesize from Perplexity research dump)
- Firefox `content.js` rebuild from this engine
- Playwright e2e re-run (unit at 157/157)
- README pass

## [7.0.0] — STABLE (2026-06-14)

**51/51 e2e tests passing across 11 Playwright spec files. 140/140 unit tests passing.**

All real bugs found by Replit's test suite have been fixed. The boot-a failure that persisted across multiple Replit rounds was confirmed as stale-code false positive — our fix was already in main, and Replit's fresh-checkout run confirms 51/51 green.

### Test coverage at stable
135 unit tests (jest) + 51 e2e tests (Playwright chromium). Runs on every push via GitHub Actions two-job CI (unit + e2e jobs).

### Complete bug history for this version

| Patch | Bug | Found by | Fixed |
|-------|-----|----------|-------|
| patch1 | HALT-first bypass — `LEGACY_PROCEED` is substring of sigil, double-counting defeated halt invariant | CI (jest signal.test.js) | else-if guard on legacy keywords |
| patch1 | Non-deterministic SHA-256 fallback used Math.random() | CI (jest capsule.test.js) | djb2 deterministic hash |
| patch2 | `GM_addStyle` + `panel.appendChild` at module scope crashed at document-start | Replit Playwright round 1 | `injectStyles()` + `mountPanel()` inside `safeBoot()` |
| patch3 | Input selectors matched GITL's own settings textarea | Replit Playwright round 2 | `_isOwnUI()` excludes `#gitl` descendants from all DOM queries |
| patch4 | MutationObserver blind to CSS-revealed Continue buttons | Replit Playwright round 3 | Added `attributes: true` with `attributeFilter` to observer |



From Replit e2e round 3.

### Improvement
- **MutationObserver now watches attributes** (`style`, `class`, `hidden`, `disabled`, `aria-hidden`) in addition to childList/subtree. A "Continue generating" button revealed via CSS (rather than freshly inserted into the DOM) now triggers the auto-click fast-path. Still debounced 300ms and gated on `state === 'RUNNING'`.

### Not bugs (documented in DEVLOG)
- Export returning early on a page with zero messages is correct behavior, not a defect. An empty conversation has nothing to export.

### Tests
- `tests/e2e/behavior.spec.js` added.

## [7.0.0-patch3] — Own-UI selector exclusion (2026-06-13)

From Replit e2e round 2.

### Bug fix
- **Selector collision with own UI:** the input/recovery selectors (e.g. `textarea:not([disabled])`) could match GITL's own settings textarea (`#cfg-sites`). Added `_isOwnUI(el)` helper; `_q()` and `_qAll()` now skip any element inside `#gitl`. Hardened `mountPanel()` to remove a stray pre-existing `#gitl`.
- Tests: 5 static-analysis tests in `structure.test.js`. Unit suite now 140.

### Not a regression (documented in DEVLOG)
- Replit's reported boot crash at "line 1978" was a stale checkout predating patch2. Live `main` has the panel mount inside `mountPanel()` within `safeBoot()`, fully guarded.

## [7.0.0-patch2] — Boot Crash Fix (2026-06-13)

Found by a Replit headful Playwright test injecting at `document-start` — the timing our unit tests couldn't simulate.

### Bug fix (CRITICAL — script failed to load)
- **Top-level DOM mutation crash:** `GM_addStyle()` and `document.body.appendChild(panel)` ran at module-eval time, outside `safeBoot()`. At `document-start`, `document.head` and `document.body` are null → `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'appendChild')` → script halted before any storage write.
- **Fix:** Wrapped both in deferred functions (`injectStyles()` with head/documentElement fallback; `mountPanel()` with null-body guard), called inside `safeBoot()` before `render()`. Added idempotency guards.
- **Lesson:** `safeBoot()` only protects code inside its callback. Zero DOM mutation allowed at top level.

### Tests added
- `tests/boot.test.js` — 9 static-analysis tests ensuring no unguarded top-level DOM mutation. Unit suite now 135 tests.
- `tests/e2e/boot.spec.js` — 6 Playwright tests injecting at real `document-start` timing against `tests/e2e/mock-chat.html`. This is the tier that actually reproduces the crash.
- CI now runs two jobs: `unit` (jest) and `e2e` (Playwright + chromium).

### Known gap (now closed)
- Unit tests run in jsdom where `document.body` already exists — they cannot catch `document-start` boot-order bugs. The Playwright e2e tier closes this gap.

## [7.0.0-patch1] — CI Bug Fixes (2026-06-13, same day as v7.0.0)

Found by the 126-test CI suite that was added alongside v7.0.0. Both bugs were in the code before CI existed — they shipped silently.

### Bug fixes

**HALT-first bypass (CRITICAL)**
- `LEGACY_PROCEED = 'PROCEED'` is a substring of `'[[GITL::PROCEED]]'`. When the sigil fired, the legacy keyword check also fired, adding 3 unearned points to `pScore`. With both sigils present: `hScore=4`, `pScore=7` → condition `hScore >= pScore` failed → proceed won.
- Impact: any response containing both sigils would always proceed, never halt. The most important invariant was silently broken.
- Fix: `else-if` — legacy check only fires when the sigil is absent. See `detectSignal()`.
- Test: `signal.test.js` — "HALT wins when both sigils present"

**Non-deterministic SHA-256 fallback (MEDIUM)**
- `gitlSha256()` catch block used `Math.random()`. When `crypto.subtle.digest` throws, identical messages got different hashes every time → deduplication silently failed.
- Fix: Replaced `Math.random()` with deterministic djb2 hash in fallback path.
- Test: `capsule.test.js` — "same input → same hash"

### CI infrastructure added
- `tests/setup.js` — VM harness with GM_* mocks, crypto shim, history shim, IIFE export hook
- `tests/version.test.js` — version consistency (8 tests)
- `tests/structure.test.js` — S0-S5 module presence + security invariants (44 tests)
- `tests/signal.test.js` — `detectSignal()` + `parseProgress()` (21 tests)
- `tests/timeline.test.js` — Timeline record/cap/query/persistence (8 tests)
- `tests/health.test.js` — `platformHealth()` scoring + `randomDelay()` bounds (9 tests)
- `tests/capsule.test.js` — SHA-256 dedup + capsule v2 schema (15 tests)
- `tests/tablock.test.js` — tab lock claim/release/expiry/corrupt (13 tests)
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — runs on every push + PR to main

## [7.0.0] — The Runtime Controller

Built from a multi-AI research synthesis: 7 analysis documents, 5 ChatGPT GPT sessions (Code, Ethical Hacker, HTML/CSS/JS, Software Architect), DeepSeek, Gemini, Perplexity, and Kimi — each analyzing the codebase, competitors, and failure modes independently. Claude synthesized, critiqued, and built.

### S0 — Boot Safety (fixes v7.0-alpha loading failures)
- **`safeBoot()`**: rAF + DOMContentLoaded boot guard — MutationObserver and render only fire once document.body exists. Catches and logs boot errors to GM storage.
- **Tab lock**: `crypto.randomUUID()` per-tab identity, heartbeat every 5s via `GM_setValue` with 8s expiry. Only one GITL instance per conversation route runs the loop. Auto-pauses if lock is lost.
- **Focus guard**: `assertInteractionSafe()` gate on every `engineSend` — blocks sends when tab lacks focus or another tab holds the lock. Prevents background token burn.
- **`beforeunload` cleanup**: releases tab lock on tab close.

### S1 — Network Interceptor
- **Fetch proxy**: intercepts `window.fetch` responses to known AI endpoints, clones the stream, parses SSE `data:` lines in a non-blocking background reader.
- **XHR proxy**: fallback for platforms not using fetch — hooks `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open/send`.
- **8 endpoint patterns**: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, HuggingChat, Gemini, Copilot, generic.
- **`GITL_NET.bus`**: `EventTarget` emitting `gitl:net` custom events with `{raw, isDone, ts}`. Supplements DOM detection — does not replace it.

### S2 — Selector Doctor + Health Badge
- **`platformHealth()`**: scores platform readiness 0–100 across four axes: canRead (25), canInject (30), canSend (30), canExport (15).
- **🟢🟡🔴 badge**: visible in panel header next to platform name. Green ≥80, Yellow ≥40, Red <40.
- **Diagnostics integration**: health score, network interceptor status, and tab ID shown in Diagnostics panel.

### S3 — Timeline (Event Log)
- **Append-only event log**: capped at 500 entries in `GM_setValue`. Records boot, send success/failure, halt, pause, diagnostics, recovery attempts, exports.
- **`Timeline.record(type, data)`**: every significant system event is logged with platform, workflow, and ISO timestamp.
- **`Timeline.failures()`** and **`Timeline.since(ms)`**: query helpers for observability and failure learning.

### S4 — Recovery Engine + GhostBus
- **`RecoveryEngine.recoverSend(text)`**: 5-strategy escalation chain with exponential backoff (500ms→1s→2s→4s→8s): contenteditable reinsert → native setter → direct value → Enter key dispatch → refocus + retry. Every attempt logged to Timeline.
- **Wired into `engineSend`**: when primary inject or input-finding fails, RecoveryEngine takes over before pausing.
- **`GhostBus`**: `BroadcastChannel('gitl.bus.v1')` for cross-tab communication. Discovers peer tabs, sends handoff capsules. **Security**: received handoffs are stored for user to manually apply — never auto-injected.

### S5 — Enhanced Export: Capsule v2
- **`gitlSha256(text)`**: Web Crypto API hash for message deduplication — eliminates duplicates from virtualized DOM re-renders.
- **`buildCapsuleV2(messages)`**: produces `gitl.capsule.v2` JSON with DAG-linked messages (parentId), SHA-256 fingerprints, resume token, health snapshot, and timeline summary.
- **💊 Capsule v2 button**: new export option in the Export tab. Downloads `.gitl.json` files.
- **Deduplication count**: capsule reports how many duplicate messages were removed.

### Architecture
- Version guard updated to `__GITL_V7__`
- All v6.9.0 features preserved: 20+ platform adapters, workflows, personas, diagnostics, export modes, handoff, roadmap autopilot, prompt queue, API-first export, rescue mode, walk-away alerts.
- Extension wrapper rebuilt for Firefox MV3.

## [6.9.0] — Standing on Shoulders

We audited the top open-source exporters' actual code (pionxzh/chatgpt-exporter 2.5k★, socketteer/Claude-Conversation-Exporter, SaveMyPhind, claude-chat-handoff) to absorb their lessons instead of re-living their bugs.

### The lesson
The mature exporters don't scrape the DOM — they call the platform's own conversation API: complete history, exact roles, structured thinking, immune to virtualization and UI redesigns.

### Added — API-first export
- **ChatGPT**: session token via `/api/auth/session`, conversation via `backend-api/conversation/{id}`, then a parent-pointer walk of the node tree from `current_node` — which correctly resolves branches and regenerations, something DOM scraping can never do (technique: pionxzh)
- **Claude**: `/api/organizations/{org}/chat_conversations/{id}?tree=True&render_all_tools=true` — full tool calls and thinking blocks as structured data (technique: socketteer), **improved**: orgId is auto-fetched from `/api/organizations` instead of making the user paste it manually (their #1 setup complaint)
- DOM extraction remains as automatic fallback (and the primary path on Manus, Gemini and others without a mined API — our virtualized harvest stays unique there)
- Veil shows a short "Fetching from platform archive" flow on the API path; failures log to Diagnostics and fall through silently to DOM


## [6.8.1]

### Added
- Quiet "♡ Support Ghost" link: footer of the Setup tab and the Help → Feedback section, in both the userscript and the Firefox extension. Points at GitHub Sponsors via a single `SUPPORT_URL` constant (one-line swap if the destination ever changes). Deliberately muted styling — visible to those who look, invisible to those who don't.


## [6.8.0] — Structure Survives

### Fixed
- **Tables export as tables**: Manus (and any platform's) HTML tables were flattening into numbered-list soup in exports. Extraction now serializes every `<table>` into a proper markdown pipe table in place.

### Added
- **📎 File manifest**: Manus creates files mid-task (scripts, PRDs, syntheses — its working artifacts). Exports now end with a "Files created in this task" list so nothing silently vanishes, with a reminder that contents live in Manus's file panel and should be downloaded before the session expires.
- **FUNDING.yml scaffold** (commented/inert): uncomment a line and add a handle to activate GitHub's Sponsor button.

### Honest limits
- File CONTENTS can't be scraped from the chat DOM — Manus stores them server-side behind its viewer. The manifest tells you what to download; pulling actual contents would need Manus's authenticated API and is out of scope for a userscript.


## [6.7.0] — Evidence-Based Handoff

The generic "Capsule" is gone. We researched how the community actually transfers context between AI models (handoff extensions, claude-chat-handoff, the Handoff Prompt pattern, conversation-handoff MCP) and rebuilt around the validated patterns.

### What the research said
- Context transfer between models is a real, established need — it's a whole product category
- The consensus format is an **AI-written structured briefing**, not a scraped transcript: raw transcripts bury decisions in noise
- A scraped file has exactly one irreplaceable job: a chat that's **full/stuck and can't be prompted anymore**

### Changed
- **📦 Capsule file → 🛟 Rescue file**: purpose-named for its real use case (dead/stuck chats). Now includes the last 10 messages VERBATIM (both roles), mission, state, and resumption instructions — modeled on the proven stuck-chat recovery format.
- **📦 Ask in chat → 🤝 Handoff**: promoted to the primary transfer path, since the AI's own structured briefing is the community-validated format.
- Export tab and Help now teach the three-purpose model: *Working chat → Handoff. Dead chat → Rescue. Records → Export.*


## [6.6.0] — The Veil

Export is no longer a silent mystery. Users see what's happening, how far along it is, and have a safe way out.

### Added — export progress overlay ("the Veil")
- Screen dims softly; a 👻 with a spinning ring sits center-stage with a named step list: Reading chat → Opening thinking blocks → Collecting every message → Building your file (✓ done / ▶ current)
- **Real progress bar** with % — computed from the actual page length on virtualized chats; indeterminate slide animation when a phase has no measurable length
- **Stall watchdog**: quiet for 8s → "Still working — the page is slow. Don't reload." Quiet for 25s → "This looks stuck. Cancel is safe — Ghost keeps what it collected."
- **Safe Cancel**: aborts the harvest mid-scroll and exports everything collected so far — no more page reloads out of uncertainty

### Changed — the Capsule earns its keep
- Now opens with a one-line purpose statement: *a baton, not a record — paste into a fresh AI to continue; use Export for the full transcript*
- Captures the **Mission** (your first prompt) and the last **5** outputs, alongside roadmap position and state
- **Idle guidance**: exporting a capsule with no loop state (no roadmap, no workflow, zero rounds) now tells you "Ask in chat" or Export may serve better, instead of silently producing a generic file


## [6.5.0] — The Friendly Ghost

UX pass driven by real user testing. The goal: nobody should need a tutorial.

### Fixed — Manus export completeness (root cause from field evidence)
- The harvest's blind 150-step safety cap stopped ~⅔ through long chats (this one was 115,000px tall and needed ~235 steps). The cap is now computed from the actual chat height (up to 800 steps), with live "Harvesting… N%" progress.
- **Bottom settle**: virtualizers render the tail late — harvest now forces scroll-to-bottom twice with longer waits, so the last outputs are captured.
- **Fragment merging**: Manus plan-steps exported as ~170 separate one-line "Assistant" sections; consecutive same-role fragments now merge into readable blocks.

### UX — window controls that behave like windows
- Collapse control is now context-aware: docked panels use ◀ expand / ▶ collapse (horizontal, matching the edge), floating panels use ＋ / － like every window the user already knows.
- Docked + collapsed: the entire strip is the tap-to-expand target — only ▶ stays the play button.

### UX — Help Center (the ? button)
- One topic per view, picked by pills: Start · Run · Auto · Flow · Roles · Export · Setup · Feedback — FAQ-style, written in plain language.
- Answers the real questions: "Export vs Capsule?", "Roadmap vs Workflow?", "Why did it pause?"
- Feedback section links GitHub issues and tells users exactly what to include (version, platform, Probe output).


## [6.4.0] — Field Repairs

Built from real-world Manus testing: actual exported files and saved page DOM drove every fix.

### Fixed — Manus export (evidence-based)
- **Root causes found in the real DOM**: Manus virtualizes the chat (off-screen turns don't exist in the DOM), nests `data-event-id` containers (one match contained the whole thread → duplicated mega-blobs), uses a Tiptap ProseMirror input (the visible `<textarea>` belongs to the Monaco code viewer — a decoy), and collapses steps with CSS grid animation instead of `<details>`/aria-expanded.
- **Scroll harvest**: on Manus, export now scrolls the virtualized list top→bottom collecting every turn by event id, in order, with correct user/assistant roles
- **Chrome stripping**: UI noise (Task completed, Suggested follow-ups, View more, Knowledge recalled, counters) removed from exports
- **Nested-match dedupe** in the generic extractor: ancestors of other matches are dropped, duplicate texts skipped
- **Manus profile corrected**: ProseMirror-first input (useCE), `[data-event-id]` turns
- **Thinking expansion** now opens Manus-style grid-collapsed step sections (only genuinely collapsed ones)

### Added
- **Word tabs**: Run · Auto · Flow · Roles · Export · Setup — no more emoji guessing
- **? help view** (header button): what every tab does, plus Roadmap-vs-Workflow explained with a concrete example (Workflow = your fixed recipe; Roadmap = AI invents the plan for this task)
- **📦 Ask in chat**: second capsule path — Ghost prompts the AI to write its own complete handoff report (mission, everything tried, failures + why, current state, next steps, fresh-AI instructions) in one code block. Works even where DOM scraping is hostile.
- **Structured queue editor**: one input per step, ＋ Add step, ✕ remove; during a run each step shows ✓ done / ▶ current / · pending with strikethrough on completion
- **Dock position** (▐): panel docks to the screen edge; collapsed it's a 32px vertical tab that blocks nothing — the closest safe equivalent to living inside the site's own UI


## [6.3.0] — Deep Export

**Export the thinking, not just the chat.** Reasoning logs on most platforms hide behind collapsed "Thinking" toggles that scrapers miss — the known workaround is expanding every toggle by hand before exporting. Ghost now does that automatically, from inside the page.

### Added
- **💭 Thinking logs** (Export tab, on by default): before extracting, Ghost auto-expands collapsed reasoning — opens every `<details>` block and clicks Thinking/Thought/Reasoning/Show-steps toggles (3 passes, marks what it clicked, never touches its own panel) — then captures thinking blocks per message.
- Markdown exports render thinking as `> 💭 Thinking` blockquotes above each response; JSON exports carry a `thinking` field per message.
- Works on Manus, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and any platform using standard collapse patterns — no separate exporter extension needed.

### Notes
- Thinking text is subtracted from the main body to avoid double-capture; if a platform interleaves it non-contiguously, minor duplication may remain
- Handoff Capsules intentionally stay thinking-free (final outputs only)


## [6.2.0] — The Autopilot

**Walk away with everything ready.** The roadmap is no longer something you write — the AI researches the task, plans it, and Ghost executes the whole plan unattended.

### Added
- **🗺 Roadmap Autopilot** (third mode): response 1 is research + a machine-readable plan under `[[GITL::ROADMAP]]`; Ghost parses the numbered steps, runs each one as its own focused prompt, then fires a final synthesis prompt that compiles the deliverable and HALTs. Steps persist across crashes; Flow tab shows live ✓/▶/· progress.
- **Prompt Queue**: paste your own steps (one per line) in the Flow tab — they run hands-free on the same roadmap engine. AI-planned or user-planned, one executor.
- **📦 Handoff Capsule** (Export tab): one file containing mission/state YAML, roadmap position, the last 3 outputs, and an explicit next-lens contract (independent assessment, continue from ▶, deliverable-first, sigil protocol). Built for model-to-model relay — the state-export pattern, productized.
- **Lens Relay workflow**: a real model-switch round table. Pause-between on → swap the model (Perplexity selector or any manual switch) → press ▶. Four escalating lens turns: independent take → gaps → synthesis candidate → verified consensus.
- **Live Round Table on Perplexity**: the Round Table persona auto-switches to a model-relay variant on Perplexity — independent assessment, no default agreement, code-block output, names the next model each turn.
- **Walk-away notifications**: desktop notification on complete / pause / error (Settings toggle, permission requested on enable).
- **Config backup & restore**: every Ghost setting to/from one JSON file (Export tab).
- **Shadow DOM piercing**: when normal selectors miss, the adapter walks shadow roots (throttled, depth-capped) — Copilot-style shadow UIs and future platforms become reachable.
- **Auto-probe on failure**: input-missing, inject-failed, and no-output pauses now run the selector probe automatically and open Diagnostics — the panel tells you what broke.

### UI/UX — Small Package, Many Options
- **Hard mobile guarantee**: panel body is capped at min(52vh, 380px) and scrolls internally — the panel can never over-cover the chat on a phone, regardless of tab content. Panel width also capped to the viewport.
- **Six focused icon tabs** (with tooltips): ▶ Run · 🗺 Autopilot · 🔁 Workflows · 🎭 Personas · ⬇ Export · ⚙ Settings. The first tab is the standard continue experience and nothing else.
- **Autopilot gets its own tab**: roadmap progress + prompt queue moved out of Workflows — each tab now does one job.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Export and Settings show only the essentials; everything power-user (filters, slug, backup/restore, signal window, custom keywords, custom sites, diagnostics) lives behind a persisted "Advanced ▾" expander.
- Settings basics reduced to: max rounds, sound, notify, position, quick start.

### Changed
- Roadmap mode and workflows are mutually exclusive (roadmap wins) to prevent prompt collisions
- Crash recovery message reports roadmap position
- Mode buttons compacted to fit three modes

### Notes
- Roadmap capture requires the numbered list format; if the AI free-styles, Ghost pauses with a clear message instead of guessing


## [6.1.0] — The Open Door

**Root cause fixed: the generic adapter was dead code.** v6.0's generic fallback could never run — Tampermonkey only injects on `@match` domains, and only the 8 dedicated platforms were listed. Any unlisted site (like Manus) never loaded the script at all. v6.1.0 opens the door.

### Added
- **Manus** dedicated platform profile (`manus.im`) with best-effort fallback selector chains
- **13 labeled generic platforms** now in the `@match` list, routed through a widened generic adapter: Mistral, Kimi, Qwen, Meta AI, Poe, HuggingChat, You.com, Pi, Z.ai, Genspark, MiniMax, LMArena, Duck.ai
- **Custom sites** (Settings): per-host selector overrides as JSON, persisted via GM storage and prepended at adapter init — fix any platform without touching code. Pair with Tampermonkey "User matches" to activate on any URL.
- **Selector probe** (Settings → Diagnostics): one click live-tests input/send/stop/assistant chains and reports the winning selector + match count — the fast path for diagnosing a broken or new platform
- **Quick-start card**: 3-step onboarding on first run, dismissible, reopenable from Settings (closes the onboarding gap flagged in the v6.0 pre-build committee)

### Changed
- Generic adapter selector chains widened (role="textbox", data-testid send/stop, markdown/prose/assistant message patterns) — substantially higher hit rate on unknown chat UIs
- Generic adapter now labels known hosts (shows "Kimi", not "Generic")

### Notes
- Manus and generic-roster selectors are unverified fallback chains by design — run Probe on first use and report winners (or paste overrides into Custom sites)


## [6.0.0] — 2026-06-07

### Architecture
- Complete rewrite: 5-layer architecture (adapters → state → diagnostics → signal → engine)
- Loop engine never touches DOM — all DOM access through platform adapters
- Single GHOST state object replaces split CONFIG/STATE
- Generic fallback adapter for unknown platforms

### New Features
- **Claude platform support** with ProseMirror-aware selectors
- **Workflow pipelines** (6): Deep Research, R&D Lab, Shipyard, Debate, Pre-Mortem, Trollproof
- **Persona library** (8): Researcher, Builder, Red Team, Devil's Advocate, Tester, Customer Voice, Executive, Round Table
- **Tabbed UI**: Run | Flow | Personas | Export | Settings

- **Enhanced export**: Markdown/JSON format, filter by role or code blocks, role labels toggle, filename preview
- **Diagnostics panel**: adapter, platform, selector, send path, signal, round, state, errors
- **First-run hint**: shows onboarding tooltip for new users
- **Workflow auto-advance**: HALT signal on active workflow injects next stage prompt automatically
- **Pause between stages** toggle for workflow pipelines

### Reliability
- Unique sigils `[[GITL::PROCEED]]` / `[[GITL::HALT]]` as primary signals (legacy keywords as fallback)
- Confidence-scored signal detection (sigils +4, legacy +3, fuzzy +2, progress +2)
- Halt-first priority: HALT always wins when both signals present
- Randomized 8–15s delay with adaptive shortening on planning rounds (2s for round 1)
- 5-path send: contenteditable → native setter → direct value → button retries → Enter key
- ProseMirror fix: selectAll+insertText instead of innerHTML clear (preserves editor state)

## [4.2.0] — Think First

**The core question this release answered:** what happens when the user doesn't know how complex the task is?

Loop mode assumed you already understood the scope — that you'd handed the AI a known multi-step task and simply needed someone to handle the relay. This worked well for structured work. It worked considerably less well when the task was open-ended, poorly scoped, or genuinely complex in ways the user hadn't anticipated. In those cases, the AI would invent a step count, commit to it prematurely, and produce output that was technically structured but architecturally wrong.

**Think First mode** addresses this by inverting the sequence. The first response is dedicated entirely to planning — the AI reads the task, assesses its genuine complexity, determines an appropriate batch count at approximately 80% of its comfortable response capacity (a deliberate margin, chosen because the back 20% of a full-capacity response is where precision goes to die), and states the plan explicitly before touching any actual work. Subsequent responses execute the plan, one batch at a time.

The 80% figure is not arbitrary. Extended research into AI output degradation patterns consistently shows that accuracy and coherence decline toward the end of near-capacity responses as the model prioritizes completion over correctness. Capping at 80% is the difference between a response that finishes cleanly and one that rushes.

**Also in this release:**
- Mode toggle preserved across sessions
- Progress bar now parses both `[Step X of Y]` and `[Batch X of Y]` formats
- Payload preview updates dynamically when switching modes
- Panel UI refined for clarity

## [4.1.0] — The Payload Becomes Visible

**The core question this release answered:** why should the user have to trust something they can't see?

The original architecture injected the loop protocol silently and completely. Users installing a third-party script were asked, implicitly, to trust that the text being appended to their prompts was benign, purposeful, and not doing something strange. This was a reasonable concern and an unreasonable ask.

This release introduced the payload preview panel — a collapsible section showing exactly what text gets appended to every prompt, in plain language, before it's sent. The intent was dual: transparency for the cautious user, and utility for anyone who wanted to understand *why* the protocol wording was chosen the way it was.

The progress bar was also introduced in this release. The loop had always tracked rounds internally, but the absence of visible feedback created an uncomfortable experience — the user pressed play and then had no indication whether things were proceeding or whether something had quietly gone wrong. Parsing the AI's `[Step X/Y]` output and rendering it as a visual bar addressed this without requiring any changes to the core loop logic.

**Also in this release:**
- Cycle-aware Play: completing or stopping a task automatically resets the payload flag, so the next prompt starts fresh without manual intervention
- Round counter displayed in panel

## [4.0.0] — The Platform Problem

**The core question this release answered:** why does a workflow automation script only work on one website?

The V3 architecture was ChatGPT-specific in ways that were architectural rather than incidental — the selector logic, the text injection method, and the send detection were all hardcoded around ChatGPT's React-controlled textarea and specific button attributes. Expanding platform support required rethinking injection as a solved problem with known variants rather than a single implementation.

Three injection paths were implemented and mapped to platforms:
1. React native setter (ChatGPT)
2. ContentEditable with execCommand (Gemini, Perplexity)
3. Plain textarea with synthetic events (DeepSeek, Copilot, Grok)

Each platform received a profile — an object containing its selector chains, injection method, and behavioral flags — allowing the detection and execution logic to remain platform-agnostic. Selector chains were implemented as ordered fallback arrays rather than single selectors, drawing on observed DOM patterns across platforms and building in resilience against minor UI revisions.

MutationObserver was added alongside the polling loop specifically to handle the "Continue generating" button in ChatGPT — a UI element that appears and disappears dynamically and benefits from immediate detection rather than waiting for the next poll cycle.

**Also in this release:**
- Draggable panel with persisted position
- Keyboard shortcuts (Alt+P, Alt+S)
- Round limit with configurable cap
- Completion chime (two-tone, Web Audio API)

## [3.0.0] — The State Machine

*Prior to public release. Documented here for completeness.*

The V1 and V2 implementations were functionally correct but behaviorally fragile — if the AI produced a response that contained neither the continuation signal nor the stop signal (a clarifying question, a protocol deviation, an unexpected formatting choice), the loop would continue polling indefinitely, silently burning through the user's token allocation with nothing to show for it.

V3 introduced a strict three-state machine: RUNNING, PAUSED, and COMPLETE. Deviation from the expected response pattern triggered an automatic transition to PAUSED, flagging the deviation explicitly rather than ignoring it. This was accompanied by moving the operational parameters from manual entry to automatic injection — the V1/V2 requirement that users type the protocol rules before engaging the loop was identified as the kind of design decision that sounds reasonable in planning and fails immediately in practice.

## [5.0.0] — Reliability Core

**The question that drove this release:** what if every assumption about signal detection, text injection, and loop lifecycle was wrong?

An extended audit — cross-referencing Code Copilot's architectural proposals, a PHP developer's DOM resilience review, competitive analysis of adamlui/chatgpt-auto-continue, fogel.dev's MutationObserver research, and Mozilla's WebExtension documentation — revealed that the v4 architecture was correct in intention but fragile in execution. The selector chains worked but weren't cached. The signal detection worked but couldn't distinguish a quoted `PROCEED` from a real one. The send engine worked but had no lock, no fallback timing, and no defense against automation detection heuristics.

v5.0 is a clean rewrite around six principles:

1. **Halt-first priority.** HALT always wins. A false halt costs one click to resume; a false proceed costs tokens, context, and potentially an automation flag. The prior "proceed beats halt" rule was reversed after red-team analysis showed it created silent runaway conditions.

2. **Confidence scoring.** Signals are weighted: unique sigils (`[[GITL::PROCEED]]`) score +4, legacy keywords +3, fuzzy patterns +2, progress bars +2. Minimum threshold of 3 required to act. The panel shows the score so the user can see exactly why the script did or didn't continue.

3. **Randomized inter-message delay.** 8–15 seconds, drawn uniformly at random. This is not a performance feature — it is a defense against automation detection on platforms that monitor message cadence. The delay adds latency the user is already absent for and costs nothing.

4. **Watchdog timer.** Borrowed from embedded systems practice. Stage 1 (soft, 90s) logs a warning. Stage 2 (hard, 180s) pauses the loop. Every successful DOM mutation or send operation resets the timer. If feeds stop, the script assumes it's stuck — selector break, network failure, or platform error state — and fails safely.

5. **Send lock + triple fallback.** The send engine acquires a lock (preventing double-sends from tick/observer race conditions), injects text, waits 500ms for the platform to enable the send button, clicks it if found, retries once at 600ms, and falls back to a synthetic Enter keypress if both button attempts fail. The lock releases after 1500ms. The panel reports which path succeeded.

6. **Unique signal tokens.** `[[GITL::PROCEED]]` and `[[GITL::HALT]]` are vanishingly unlikely to appear in normal AI output, code blocks, or quoted text. The engine still recognizes legacy `PROCEED`/`SYSTEM_HALT` (weighted lower) for backward compatibility and third-party workflows.

**Also in this release:**

- SPA route detection via pushState/replaceState monkey-patching
- Selector caching with route-change invalidation
- TXT and JSON export of full conversations
